This project follows [OpenSSF (Open Source Security Foundation)](https://openssf.org/) security best practices, achieving high scores on the [Scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard) and [Best Practices Badge](https://www.bestpractices.dev/).

## Overview

**Estimated Scorecard Score**: 9.0/10 (Excellent)
**Best Practices Compliance**: 95%+ (Passing)

This template implements comprehensive security controls including:

- ✅ Signed releases with Sigstore/Cosign
- ✅ SLSA Level 3 provenance attestations
- ✅ Continuous fuzzing with ClusterFuzzLite
- ✅ Branch protection with scoped permissions
- ✅ Automated dependency updates
- ✅ Comprehensive security scanning

---

## Security Features

### 1. Signed Releases 🔐

All releases are cryptographically signed using [Sigstore/Cosign](https://www.sigstore.dev/) for keyless signing.

**What it provides:**

- Cryptographic proof of authenticity
- Verification that releases come from this repository
- Protection against supply chain attacks
- Certificate transparency

**Workflow**: `.github/workflows/release.yml`

**How to verify a release**:

```bash
# Install cosign
brew install cosign  # macOS
# or download from https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/releases

# Download release artifacts
wget https://github.com/ByronWilliamsCPA/fragrance_rater/releases/download/v1.0.0/package.whl
wget https://github.com/ByronWilliamsCPA/fragrance_rater/releases/download/v1.0.0/package.whl.sig
wget https://github.com/ByronWilliamsCPA/fragrance_rater/releases/download/v1.0.0/package.whl.pem

# Verify signature
cosign verify-blob \
  --certificate package.whl.pem \
  --signature package.whl.sig \
  --certificate-identity-regexp="https://github.com/ByronWilliamsCPA/fragrance_rater" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer="https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \
  package.whl
```

### 2. SLSA Provenance 🔗

[SLSA (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts)](https://slsa.dev/) Level 3 provenance attestations are generated for all releases.

**What it provides:**

- Build environment details
- Source repository verification
- Complete build reproducibility metadata
- Independent verification of the build process

**Workflow**: `.github/workflows/release.yml` (provenance job)

**How to verify provenance**:

```bash
# Download provenance file
wget https://github.com/ByronWilliamsCPA/fragrance_rater/releases/download/v1.0.0/attestation.intoto.jsonl

# Verify with slsa-verifier
slsa-verifier verify-artifact package.whl \
  --provenance-path attestation.intoto.jsonl \
  --source-uri github.com/ByronWilliamsCPA/fragrance_rater
```

### 3. Continuous Fuzzing 🐛

Automated fuzzing with [ClusterFuzzLite](https://google.github.io/clusterfuzzlite/) discovers security vulnerabilities.

**What it provides:**

- Discovery of crashes and hangs
- Memory safety violations (via AddressSanitizer)
- Edge case detection
- Security vulnerability identification

**Workflow**: `.github/workflows/cifuzzy.yml`
**Fuzz Harnesses**: `fuzz/` directory

**How to run locally**:

```bash
# Install Atheris
uv pip install atheris

# Run input validation fuzzer (60 seconds)
python fuzz/fuzz_input_validation.py -max_total_time=60
```

**View fuzzing results**:

- GitHub Security tab → Code scanning alerts
- Workflow artifacts (crash samples)

### 4. Branch Protection 🛡️

Enforced branch protection rules prevent unauthorized changes.

**Protection rules**:

- ✅ Required status checks (CI / CI Pipeline, Security Analysis / Security Scan, PR Validation)
- ✅ Required pull request reviews (1 approval)
- ✅ Code owner reviews required
- ✅ Dismiss stale reviews
- ✅ Enforce for administrators
- ✅ Linear history required
- ✅ Force pushes blocked
- ✅ Branch deletions blocked
- ✅ Conversation resolution required

**Setup**:

```bash
# Set GitHub token
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN>

# Run setup script
python scripts/setup_github_protection.py
```

**Manual setup**:

1. Go to: `https://github.com/ByronWilliamsCPA/fragrance_rater/settings/branches`
2. Click "Add branch protection rule"
3. Apply protection pattern: `main`
4. Enable all recommended protections

### 5. Scoped Workflow Permissions 🔑

All GitHub Actions workflows use **least-privilege permissions**.

**Principle**: Grant only the minimum permissions needed for each job.

**Implementation**:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read        # For checkout
  pull-requests: write  # For PR comments
  checks: write         # For check runs
```

**Not this**:

```yaml
permissions: read-all  # ❌ Too permissive
```

### 6. Dependency Management 📦

Automated dependency updates and vulnerability scanning.

**Tools**:

- **Renovate**: Automated dependency updates
- **Safety**: Python dependency CVE scanning
- **OSV-Scanner**: Multi-ecosystem vulnerability detection
- **Google Assured OSS**: Vetted, secure packages

**Configuration**:

- `renovate.json` - Update automation
- `osv-scanner.toml` - Vulnerability exceptions
- `.env.example` - Assured OSS configuration

### 7. Security Scanning (SAST) 🔍

Comprehensive static analysis on every commit.

**Tools**:

- **Ruff**: Python linting with security rules
- **Bandit**: Python security issue detection
- **BasedPyright**: Type safety (prevents entire classes of bugs)
- **CodeQL**: Advanced semantic code analysis

**Workflow**: `.github/workflows/security-analysis.yml`

### 8. Mutation Testing 🧬

Ensures test quality with [mutmut](https://mutmut.readthedocs.io/).

**What it does**:

- Mutates source code (changes operators, values, etc.)
- Runs tests against mutated code
- Verifies tests catch the mutations
- Measures test effectiveness

**Configuration**: `pyproject.toml` → `[tool.mutmut]`

**Usage**:

```bash
# Run mutation testing
mutmut run

# View results
mutmut results

# Show specific mutations
mutmut show
```
